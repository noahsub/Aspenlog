# Backend Development

**Our applicationâ€™s backbone, the backend, and database**, are responsible for storing data and computations. The data from the NBCC 2020 will be stored in our **PostgreSQL database**. The algorithms developed by the civil team will be translated into **Python code** and integrated with a **REST API**.

This setup will enable our frontend applications to conveniently retrieve data in **JSON format**. To further reduce complexities in our frontend application, Python modules such as **Matplotlib** and public APIs will be routed through our backend.
